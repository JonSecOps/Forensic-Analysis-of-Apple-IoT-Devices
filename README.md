# Forensic Analysis of Apple IoT Devices

**Project Summary**

This project focused on conducting a forensic examination of multiple Apple IoT devices, including the Apple Watch, Apple TV, Apple HomePod, and Apple HomeKit. Using forensic tools such as ArtExaminer (ArtEx), iLEAPP, and DB Browser for SQLite, the investigation extracted, analyzed, and interpreted device artifacts to uncover digital evidence.
For the Apple Watch, data was parsed to identify the device’s serial number, OS version, associated iCloud account, installed applications (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger), contacts, health metrics (steps, heart rate), and geolocation history.
The Apple TV analysis revealed device metadata, Wi-Fi connections, and the last media played.
The Apple HomePod analysis identified network connections, MAC addresses, and system configurations, while the Apple HomeKit examination used SQLite database analysis to determine the last time a smart home door was opened.

This project simulated a realistic forensic workflow for IoT ecosystems, emphasizing evidence preservation, tool interoperability, and cross-device artifact correlation..

**Learning Tools**

  1. Gained practical experience in IoT forensics by examining digital artifacts across interconnected Apple devices.
  2. Learned to utilize specialized forensic tools (ArtEx and iLEAPP) for extracting and interpreting structured and unstructured data.
  3. Developed the ability to correlate evidence between devices to build a coherent digital timeline.
  4. Enhanced understanding of Apple ecosystem data storage, including HealthKit, iCloud, and messaging applications.
  5. Practiced database analysis techniques using SQLite and Epochconverter for timestamp interpretation.
  6. Strengthened awareness of the forensic value of IoT data, such as location tracking, user activity, and communications.
